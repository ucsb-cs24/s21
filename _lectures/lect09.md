# Topics

* Challenges in measuring time efficiency and the pros/cons of different methods - absolute time, counting steps 
* Measuring the impact of algorithms on running time (independent of implementation details/hardware/compiler....etc) - Count steps by detailed computer model of times to fetch, store, assign â€¦ 
* O notation - Big Oh - asymptotic analysis and orders of growth, but also briefly Little O, Big Omega, Big Theta
* Formal Big O - formula and graphical presentation
* Complexity classes - constant, logarithmic, exponential, linear, quadratic, cubic
* Best case, worst case, average case
* Example algorithms
